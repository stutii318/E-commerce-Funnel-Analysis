# E-Commerce User Behavior & Funnel Analysis

This project analyzes the customer journey of an e-commerce platform using a **Python-to-Power BI pipeline**. By processing raw event logs, I identified critical drop-off points in the conversion funnel and provided data-driven recommendations to improve the final purchase rate.


Key Insights
* Overall Conversion Rate:29.00%
* Critical Friction Point: Identified a 55% drop-off at the Checkout-to-Purchase stage.
* Segmentation: Discovered that mobile users experience higher friction during the final transaction phase compared to desktop users.
